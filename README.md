## Overview

Weaviate is an open-source vector database that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering with the scalability of a cloud-native database.

The Ballerina Weaviate vector store module provides a comprehensive API for integrating with Weaviate vector databases, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and management of high-dimensional vectors. This implementation allows being used as a Ballerina `ai:VectorStore`, providing smooth integration with the Ballerina AI module.

## Set up guide

Before using the Ballerina Weaviate vector store module, you need to set up a Weaviate instance and obtain the necessary credentials.

### Step 1: Create a Weaviate account

You can create an account for free if you don't already have one.

1. Visit [weaviate.io](https://weaviate.io/) and click **Try Now** to sign up for a free account

2. Complete the registration process and verify your email address if required
3. Log in to your new Weaviate account

For more details, refer to the official documentation on [creating a new account](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/platform/create-account).

### Step 2: Set up a Weaviate cluster

1. Access the Weaviate Console and click **Create Cluster** to create a new Weaviate instance.

2. Provide the required details (e.g., Cluster name) and preferred configuration options and confirm.

3. Click **Create** and wait for the cluster to be provisioned (this typically takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Once the cluster is ready, locate and copy the REST endpoint URL from your cluster dashboard. You'll use this URL as the `serviceUrl` in your `weaviate:Client` configuration

For more details, refer to the official documentation on [creating clusters](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/manage-clusters/create).

### Step 3: Generate API credentials

1. In the Weaviate Console, navigate to your cluster dashboard and go to the API Keys section
2. Click **Create API Key** and provide a name for the key and create the API key.

3. Securely save the generated API key, which you'll use as the `token` in your `weaviate:Client` configuration.

For more details, refer to the official documentation on [authentication](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/manage-clusters/authentication).

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Import the module

```ballerina
import ballerina/ai;
import ballerinax/ai.weaviate;
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Weaviate vector store

```ballerina
ai:VectorStore vectorStore = check new weaviate:VectorStore(
    serviceUrl = "add-weaviate-service-url", 
    config = {
        className: "add-collection-name"
    }, 
    auth = {
        token: "add-access-token"
    }
);
```

### Step 3: Add vectors

```ballerina
ai:Error? result = vectorStore.add(
    [
        {
            id: uuid:createRandomUuid(),
            embedding: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
            chunk: {
                'type: "text", 
                content: "This is a chunk"
            }
        }
    ]
);
```
